    <h1>Marinated Grilled Shrimp</h1>

    <h1>Description</h1>

    <p>
      A very simple and easy marinade that makes your shrimp so yummy you don't
      even need cocktail sauce!
    </p>

    <p>
      Don't let the cayenne pepper scare you, you don't even taste it. My 2 and
      4 year-olds love it and eat more shrimp than their parents! It is also a
      big hit with company, and easy to prepare. I make this with frozen or
      fresh shrimp and use my indoor electric grill if the weather is not good
      for outside grilling. Try it with a salad, baked potato, and garlic bread.
      You will not be disappointed!!!
